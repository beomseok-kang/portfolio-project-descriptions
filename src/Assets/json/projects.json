        "description": "‘Beomlog’ is a personal blog project using Google Firestore as the backend and database. It is an SPA react website. For good maintenance, I have written tech log for the development, and the codes were refactored as much as possible.\nBeomlog was primarily planned to service a personal blog. People can only access to the other people’s posts by either entering directly to the post using post Id, or via the homepage where the latest 10 posts are shown to people.\nThe application handles the authentication using firebase auth service, and the firestore database holds the information about posts, category, user data, etc. The application has all the basic features of personal blog space, and I am planning to add more special features that can specialise ‘Beomlog’ from other blog platforms.\nThe codes on react were written 97% with Typescript (and 3% Javascript, to use the CKEditor5 open source code) for easier tracking and maintenance. Redux was used to manage the states of user, post, category posts, dialog and loading state. Redux-saga and Redux-middleware was used to handle the asynchronous actions required for CRUD of data on firestore database. Sass was used with help of ‘node-sass’ library to style the components, and react-router was used as well. As an editor for the blog post writing, CKEditor5 was used.",

        "description": "‘Watch LCK Together’ is a react SPA, which was made in order to service an anonymous chatting, and to make people to feel like if they are watching the LCK (League of Legends Challengers Korea, Pro Game League in Korea) and chatting together in a room.\nThe main feature of this service is that the chats appears on the YouTube screen, so that the people who are watching together can see the chats instantaneously while they are watching the video, making them to feel that they are actually watching and chatting together in a room.\nThe react project was done with vanilla JS. Using ‘react-router-dom’ library, 10 + 1 rooms for each team are made. The styling of components was done with ‘node-sass’ library, using Sass (SCSS, exactly). The main theme colour of the webpage was black and grey, mainly because LCK’s theme colour is black.\nThe application is still on development. Currently, only the front-end part is finished developing, and the back-end part is to be developed as soon as possible, with Node.js, express, MongoDB, and Socket.io. As soon as the development finishes, I am planning to purchase a web domain and initiate the service as soon as the development finishes.",

        "description": "‘Naver Redesign’ is a react SPA, which was made with my personal question, “what would it be like if Naver was in a similar design with Google?” Then, I made a template page for the home and the search page, by mixing the features that can be found on both Naver and Google.\nI used ‘react-router-dom’ to provide the path for search, and used redux to manage the state of search history. Also, I used styled-components to style the components. The design was done by me, but the features and characteristics of designs were taken mainly from Naver and Google’s web design style. I tried to merge their positive features and dump the old or negative features, and I was able to learn which features can improve the user experience (UX).\nThe application is not planned to be developed further. However, with help of Naver search API or Google search API, I might later connect the website to the search APIs.",
